2. To provide hands on experience using SciLab software to handle real life problems.
Outcomes: On completion of the course, the learner will be able to:
1. Apply principles of basic operations of matrices to find rank and echelon form of matrices to
solve system of simultaneous equations.
2. Illustrate the basic concepts of Complex numbers and apply the knowledge of complex
numbers to solve problems in hyperbolic functions and logarithmic functions.
3. Illustrate the knowledge Expansion of functions.
4. Illustrate the basic principles of Partial differentiation and its application to find maxima and
minima.
5. Illustrate SciLab programming techniques to the solution of linear and simultaneous algebraic
equations.

openly express their concerns, challenges, and coping strategies.
• Facilitate meaningful conversations on stress management
techniques.
• Provide resources for support (such as counseling services) and

4 1. Emotional Intelligence and Mind Management (Any 2) 2
1. Role-Play on Conflict Resolution:
a) Find a partner: Choose a friend who is willing to participate in this role-
play activity with you.
b) Select a scenario: Together with your partner, select a conflict scenario to
role-play. It could be a common situation that often leads to conflicts, such
as a disagreement over how to divide household chores, a difference of
opinion on a project at work, or a conflict over limited resources.
c) Assign roles: Decide who will play each role in the conflict scenario. One
person will take on the role of one party involved in the conflict, and the
other person will take on the role of the other party.
d) Practice conflict resolution techniques: Use the conflict resolution
techniques you have learned, such as active listening, expressing feelings
using "I" statements, seeking common ground, and brainstorming solutions.
e) Reflect and switch roles: After the initial role-play, take a moment to
reflect on the experience. Discuss what worked well and areas that could be
improved. Then, switch roles and repeat the role-play, allowing each
participant to experience the situation from the perspective of the other
party involved in the conflict.
• Remember, the purpose of the activity is not to "win" the conflict but rather
to practice and develop the skills necessary for constructive conflict
resolution.
• Approach the role-play with an open mind, a willingness to learn, and a
commitment to respectful communication.
2. Self-Assessment and Reflection (Mood O Meter chart activity)
• Begin the tutorial by facilitating self-assessment activities that encourage
students to reflect on their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors.
