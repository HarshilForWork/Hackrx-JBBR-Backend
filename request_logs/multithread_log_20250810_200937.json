However, pre- and post-hospitalization expenses for the donor, acquisition costs, experimental treatments, post-harvesting complications, and organ transportation/preservation costs are excluded.",
      "The policy mentions an entitlement to a No Claim Discount (NCD) under Section 3.1. It specifies that any amount payable under optional covers will not affect this entitlement. However, the provided context does not specify the exact percentage or amount of the No Claim Discount offered.",
      "Yes, there is a benefit for health check-up expenses, which can be reimbursed if submitted at least forty-five days before the expiry of the third policy year. Additionally, the policy offers an optional Out-patient Treatment cover that includes consultations and diagnostic tests prescribed by a medical practitioner, which can be utilized for components of preventive health check-ups.",
