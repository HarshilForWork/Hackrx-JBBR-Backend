Pictures, \ntaken sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn, \ncoloured and framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He \nwas skilled also, in poetical composition, \" excelled in making \nverses ;\" some of these were borne in remembrance and repeated, \nseventy years afterward, by Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early \nyouth, as Miss Storey, he formed an ardent attachment. She \nwas the sister of a physician resident near Woolsthorpe ; but \nNewton's intimate acquaintance with her began at Grantham. \nwhere they were both numbered among the inmates of the same \nhouse. Two or three years younger than himself, of great per \nsonal beauty",
