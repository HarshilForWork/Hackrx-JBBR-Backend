      "Based on the provided policy documents for the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy, there is no information explicitly stating a grace period for premium payment. The provided sections discuss continuity benefits, portability, migration, and policy cancellation, but do not specify details regarding a grace period for premium renewals.",
      "The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) and their direct complications is thirty-six (36) months of continuous coverage from the inception date of the first policy. This waiting period can be reduced if the insured person has continuous coverage under portability norms, in which case prior coverage would be taken into account.",
      "Yes, this policy covers maternity expenses, including pre-natal, post-natal, and childbirth costs for female insured persons. Coverage is subject to conditions such as a 24-month continuous coverage waiting period and an age limit of 18-45 years. Additionally, maternity expenses for a surrogate mother are covered if the claim is admitted under the Infertility section (3.1.15) and a legal affidavit is submitted.",
      "Based on the provided policy documents, cataract surgery is not explicitly listed with a specific waiting period under the 'List of specific diseases/procedures' (Section 4.2.f) which outlines 90-day, one-year, two-year, and three-year waiting periods for various conditions. While 'Refractive error of the eye more than 7.5 dioptres' has a two-year waiting period, cataract surgery itself is mentioned only in terms of a coverage limit without a specified waiting period.",
      "Yes, the policy covers medical expenses for an organ donor's hospitalization during the Policy Period for harvesting an organ donated to an Insured Person. This coverage is subject to conditions, including adherence to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ being for an Insured Person, and expenses incurred while the donor is an in-patient in a hospital. However, pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses for the donor, acquisition costs of the organ, experimental treatments, complications to the donor consequent to harvesting, and organ transportation/preservation expenses are excluded.",
      "The provided policy context indicates an entitlement to a No Claim Discount (NCD) under Section 3.1. It also states that any amount payable under optional covers will not affect this entitlement. However, the specific details regarding the percentage or calculation of the No Claim Discount are not provided in this context.",
      "Based on the provided policy document excerpts, there is no mention of a benefit for preventive health check-ups. The context primarily discusses portability benefits and procedures for product withdrawal.",
      "The policy defines a 'Hospital' as any institution established for both in-patient care and day care treatment of diseases or injuries. This institution must either be registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 (or related enactments), or it must meet all specified minimum criteria outlined in the policy.",
      "The policy covers AYUSH treatments, which include medical and hospitalization treatments under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems. This is indicated by the explicit exclusion of 'Alternative Treatment (Other than AYUSH treatment)', meaning AYUSH treatments are not excluded from coverage.",
      "Yes, for Plan A, there are sub-limits on daily room charges and intensive care unit charges. These charges are payable up to the specific limits detailed in the 'Table of Benefits', unless the treatment is for a listed procedure within a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."
